What 
------
The Skagerrak Sail was a 2 week long sailing trip aboard the fullrigger Sørlandet around the Skagerrak affiliated with the [UN Decade of Ocean Research](https://oceandecade.org/). Our goal was to network researchers, managers and other stakeholders working around the Skagerrak and provide public outreach about the work that we do. At each stop on our route, we hosted public talks about marine research and management in the Skagerrak, interactive stands and an "open ship" where everyone could come on board and see the workings of a real full rig sailing ship.

My role on the trip was to lead my groups outreach effort and generally engage with the public through presentations and disuccsions at the events at shore. For our research group, we designed a stand which we could setup on the ship to present our work with video data. This included a large screen where we could present example clips from different surveys as well as phsycial examples of camera gear to show visitors. We even brought a live camera to drop over the ship in port to show the public what was hanging out in their local waters!

Arguably the most exciting part of the trip though, was sailing the ship itself. As members of the trip, the students, researchers, managers etc on board were not just passengers as we went between stops, but we were very much crew. At the start of the trip, each of us was assigned a 4 on 8 off shift to work. Mine was the 4-8 shift. This means everyone on my shift was working 4am - 8am and then 4pm - 8pm every day to sail the ship. Our duties ranged from lookout, to hauling ropes, to climbing up into the rigging to adjust sails, to steering the ship itself at the helm! There were mornings where the 4am start was not a walk in the park, especially in rough seas, but the teambuilding from this aspect of the trip really allowed us to grow together and appreciate the role each of us plays in working for our ocean.
