Course Summary
======
Have you ever wondered how sea turtles find their way back to their natal beaches to reproduce? Or how salmon easily transition from rivers to the sea? In this course we will learn how animals interact with their environment, from the molecular to the population level. We will investigate the underlying mechanisms and functions allowing animals to adapt to life in harsh environments, such as hot desserts or low oxygen environments.

Students will also get an introduction to statistical analyses and practical exercises in using R and R Studio.
