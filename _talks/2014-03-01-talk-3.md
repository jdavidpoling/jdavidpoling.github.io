Presentation of practical implementation of computer vision methods into marine ecolgy, including presentation of a new semi-supervised method for taking Maximum N (MaxN) from underwater video. Includes discussion around how the performance of machine learning models is measured, and are there better metrics we can use in our field to guage how they will perform in a real ecological task?
